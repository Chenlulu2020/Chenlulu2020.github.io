**我的感想**

规划学院内的跨学科问题：
大陆的建筑学院（包括建筑、规划、景观） 很少跨学科
大陆没有多学科的取向
我也常常感到对研究有限制：结论必须回到空间

学术研究的作者：
作者虽然说不应该看低应用研究，但作者还是发现大多数学术研究来自受到系统训练的社科背景的学者。Most of the academic literature about cities has been written by social scientists

# Reading notes_How to Study Cities

## 1.Fundamentals: disciplinary problems and scholarly debates

Why do we have cities？

How cities evolved？

- Social structures, urban culture, their internal spatial organization and relationships to other cities in systems or networks of cities, what economic functions they perform, and how they are governed.   

How cities are planned？

- How to design sites, districts, and entire cities and city regions, urban placemaking, the impact of globalization and information technology on cities and the probable future of cities, city regions, and the world city network

What cities are？→Descriptive theory, Functional theory：

What cities “ought to be”? →Normative theory

## 2.Basic Research vs Applied Research, Theory and Practice

Types of Academic writing about cities：basic research vs applied research

- basic research and theory-building

-  applied research and writing intended to produce solutions to actual urban problems

Some professors value only basic research and theory-building and look down on applied research and writing intended to produce solutions to actual urban problems.

-  Author argued that Good scholarship directed at problem-solving can be just as theoretically subtle and methodologically sophisticated as pure academic research.

- Peter Hall and others deplore the lack of connection between urban theory and urban practice.

However, most of the academic literature about cities has been written by social scientists, who have been trained to systematically study different aspects of human society from the perspective of an established social science discipline.

## 3.Disciplinary and Interdisciplinary

Professors in city and regional planning and urban studies departments are generally interdisciplinary, who have been educated in two types of academic disciplines.

Two types of disciplinary perspectives

-  social science disciplines: “urban geography,” “urban sociology,” “urban politics,” “urban economics,” or “urban anthropology,”

-  applied professional courses: Urban planning, urban design, architecture, and landscape architecture

## 4. Pros and cons of disciplines and interdisciplinary

### 1) Disciplines

A advantage of disciplines is based on agreed-upon methods for acquiring knowledge and agreed-upon body of knowledge

A disadvantage of disciplines

- There is a danger that researchers, who have been trained in  a single discipline, will think rigidly within the four corners of the discipline itself and see only  factors in their discipline as important when they study about a complex urban issue.

- Single-discipline analysis is too narrow. Disciplinary determinism of any discipline can only provide a partial explanation.

### 2) Interdisciplinary approaches

The strength of interdisciplinary approaches: a richer, more holistic, more varied understanding of multiple dimensions of the phenomena being studied

The weakness of interdisciplinary approaches

-  Interdisciplinary research and writings are often criticized as wide but shallow.

-  They may become so loose and standardless that they lack intellectual rigor.

## 5.Mixed and Multiple Research Methods

There is never only one “right” way to do urban research.

The best urban research designs are to triangulate on problems using both quantitative and qualitative research methods, which means to do both cross-sectional and longitudinal(time), qualitative and quantitative research,  (geographical) spatial analysis.

### Academic Language Bank

Normative theory

-  how things should be, what is considered ideal based on moral, ethical, or philosophical principles

Descriptive theory

-   to describe or depict phenomena as they are, without making judgments or providing explanations

Functional theory

- how systems, institutions, or processes work，what functions they serve within a particular context

Determinism（determine）vs free will  决定论

-   the belief that people are not free to choose what they are like or how they behave, because these things are decided by their environment and other things over which they have no control

Triangulation 三角测量法

-  the process of determining the location of a point by measuring angles to it from known points at either end of a fixed baseline, rather than measuring distances to the point directly (trilateration)

-  Such triangulation methods were used for accurate large-scale land surveying until the rise of global navigation satellite systems in the 1980s.

Aspatial

-   does not include geographical space as a variable

A Body of Knowledge (BOK or BoK)  知识体系

- the complete set of concepts, terms and activities that make up a professional domain
